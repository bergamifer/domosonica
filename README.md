# Domosonica

Project Overview:

Domosonica is an experimental sound spatialization project that aims to create an accessible platform for the creation and immersive listening of spatialized audio, offering a multidirectional acoustic experience. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve expensive technologies and are confined to exclusive cultural settings, Domosonica takes an inclusive approach by leveraging recycled or low-cost technological resources.

Key Features:

Inclusive Access: Domosonica is designed to break down barriers, making spatialized audio accessible to a wide range of creators, artists, students, and educators.
Community Interaction: The project fosters social connections and collaboration between diverse stakeholders in the arts and the local community.
Democratizing Sound Art: By embracing low-cost and recycled technologies, Domosonica democratizes technological sound art, making it available to a broader audience.
Cultural Enrichment: Domosonica contributes significantly to the cultural landscape of Parque de Los Patricios, aligning with the identity of the Technology District of the City.
